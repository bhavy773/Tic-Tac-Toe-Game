# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking a square with their symbol (X or O) in an attempt to get three of their symbols in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player wins or if all squares are filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.
